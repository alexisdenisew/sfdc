        <h1>Email the White House</h1>
        <input type="text" value="I'm extremely concerned about the rising cost of college education and increasing amount of student debt accumulated by graduates. These loans are a financial strain especially to those who are currently struggling to make ends meet during this economic crisis. I'm emailing to urge president Biden to support for the cancellation of all student debt. I don't want to see these young people used as a bargaining chip, so I expect President Biden to change his position on the proposed 10k in debt cancellation and demand more. Our society requires a college education for any kind of job mobility, and I think graduates deserve to live their lives free of the fear that they won't be able to pay thousands of dollars worth of debt. Please pass along my concerns to the President Biden. I'd appreciate if your office could follow up with me with any news related to this issue. I can be reached at this email. Thanks so much for taking my email." id="myInput">
